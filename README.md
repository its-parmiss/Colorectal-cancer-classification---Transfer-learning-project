# Colorectal Cancer Detection Code Explanation

This code is designed to create a model for detecting colorectal cancer using PyTorch. 

## Library Import
The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as `torch`, `numpy`, `torchvision`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn`. These libraries provide functionalities for array operations, deep learning, data visualization, and machine learning respectively.

## Mounting Google Drive
The `drive.mount('/content/drive')` command is used to mount Google Drive to the Colab notebook. This allows the notebook to access files stored in your Google Drive.

## Dataset Path
The `colorectral_dataset_path` variable is set to the path where the colorectal cancer dataset is stored in your Google Drive.

## Creating Torchvision ImageFolder Dataset
The `ImageFolder` function from the `torchvision.datasets` module is used to load the dataset from the specified path. The images are resized to 224x224 pixels and converted to tensors using the `transforms` module.

## Train, Test, Validation Splitting
The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets in a 70:15:15 ratio using the `random_split` function from the `torch.utils.data` module. Dataloaders for each set are created using the `DataLoader` function, which will load the data in batches of 16 images and shuffle them.
